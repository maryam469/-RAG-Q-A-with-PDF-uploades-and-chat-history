I built a RAG-based PDF Q&A chatbot using Streamlit, LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, and FAISS. The app allows users to upload multiple PDFs, splits them into chunks, creates embeddings, and stores them in a vector database. Using Groq LLM with history-aware retriever, it can answer user queries in real-time while remembering chat context. Each user has their own Session ID to maintain separate conversation flow.
